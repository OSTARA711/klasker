# Klasker Browser running on Linux/GTK

Klasker browser focuses exclusively on Linux systems (GTK frontend).

Goals:
- Lightweight browser for Linux desktop (GTK3)
- Modernized JS engine (QuickJS planned)
- Security hardening & faster builds.
- An ancient Celtic-inspired identity (Klasker = “Seeker” in Breton), since a browser is a seeker and displayer of webpages & information.
