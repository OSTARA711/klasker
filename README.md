# Klasker Browser running on Linux/GTK

Klasker browser focuses exclusively on Linux systems (GTK frontend).

## Objectives and Goals
- Lightweight browser for Linux desktop (GTK3)
- Modernized JS engine (QuickJS planned)
- Security hardening & faster builds.
- An ancient Celtic-inspired identity (Klasker = ‚ÄúSeeker‚Äù in Breton), since a browser is a seeker and displayer of webpages & information.

## Features to Implement

- Fetch and display HTML5 webpages from URLs
- Simple GTK3 interface with CSS3 and JavaScript support
- Cross-platform compatibility with Linux distros using GTK3
- Asynchronous fetching via `libsoup-2.4`

## Operational Requirements

- Linux OS (tested on Ubuntu/Zorin 22.04 "Jammy Jellyfish")
- GTK3 development libraries (`libgtk-3-dev`)
- libsoup-2.4 (`libsoup2.4-dev`)
- Gumbo HTML parser (`libgumbo-dev`)
- Ninja & Meson build system

## MORAL CONSIDERATIONS

You fork our source code (use our binaries) to build your own company's software.
That is great, but we would be grateful if you could share your code as well,
as it could help other companies and individuals. This is strongly encouraged,
but not required, as we understand that not all companies can afford to do this.

You fork our source code to build a product that you will then sell worldwide,
trademark it as your own (did you wrote a single line of code, at least??),
commercialise it under your own brand and earn money from our hard labour.
In that case, WE THINK THAT YOU MUST PAY BACK OR CONTRIBUTE BACK TO FOSS.

There are two ways to do so: by sharing your own source code with the FOSS community
or by buying a commercial license from us, so that we can use & invest the money in
the Klasker GTK Browser software and other projects, which benefits the whole community.

We want the Klasker GTK Browser to have a long-term impact and to be safely widespread.
We MUST become financially sustainable, thus, a steady source of revenue is imperative.

Although contributions from people who can afford to do unpaid work on FOSS projects
are very much appreciated, we cannot rely solely on them to build excellent software.
We have an ambitious mission, within a sector with a lot of powerful incumbents.

Reducing WASTE and spearheading change requires resources, a lot of time and tenacity.
